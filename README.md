# The Weather
## Five day weather forecast using server-side APIs 

We are making an application using a server side APIs called OpenWeather One Call to retrieve weather data for the user and rendering it to the page. When the user enters in a city, we are displaying the day, and the current temperature, wind speed, humidity and UV index in imperil units. The five day forecast will also be displayed down below. When the user enters in a city, their submission is then stored into local storage and assigned a button so they can compare the weather from several cities when planning their trip. 

## Things I learned and Challenges:
-I would like to go back to this project and design a way for more user interaction. They would get to have more say in which cities weather is displayed and what units the data are displayed in.  Giving the user more freedom in choosing what weather is displayed. 
-Trying to get the icons of the weather was possibly the longest task.
-I found this challenging but a fun project overall. 
-Being able to display data onto a screen from another location was really fun.
